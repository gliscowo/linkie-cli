## linkie-cli

A simple CLI tool for interacting with the Linkie API. You can either query the public instance hosted at https://linkieapi.shedaniel.me or run the [linkie-web](https://github.com/linkie/linkie-web) backend locally and use it instead. 

Currently, only mapping lookup and name translation are supported - version queries may be added later
